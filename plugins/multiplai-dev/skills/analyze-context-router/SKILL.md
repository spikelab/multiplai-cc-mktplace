# Memory Retrieval Analysis

Analyze the memory retrieval log files to assess routing quality, identify failure modes, and track improvement over time. Uses a watermark file to partition pre/post-fix data so metrics reflect only the current system behavior.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/context-router-*.log` | Daily retrieval logs (7-day retention) |
| `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/context-router-watermark.json` | Analysis watermark: last analysis timestamp, baseline metrics, deployment info |
| `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/hooks/context-router.py` | The retrieval hook source (for recommending code changes) |
| `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/memory/memory-catalog.json` | File catalog used for routing (for recommending catalog changes) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Watermark

Read `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/context-router-watermark.json`. Extract:
- `deployed_at` — timestamp of last improvement deployment
- `last_analysis` — timestamp of last analysis run
- `baseline_metrics` — metrics from the previous analysis (for delta comparison)

If no watermark exists, this is the first run. Analyze all available logs and create the watermark at the end.

### Step 2: Discover and Filter Logs

Glob `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/context-router-*.log` to find all available log files.

**Filtering rule:** Only analyze log entries with timestamps AFTER the watermark's `last_analysis`. This prevents re-analyzing data from prior runs.

If fewer than 50 events exist post-watermark, warn the user:
> "Only N events since last analysis on DATE. Recommend waiting for more data, or I can include pre-watermark data with a clear partition marker."

If the user agrees to include older data, partition the report into "pre-fix" and "post-fix" sections using `deployed_at` as the boundary.

**IMPORTANT:** Delegate the heavy log parsing to a general-purpose agent to protect the main context window from massive log files. The agent should return aggregated metrics, not raw log content.

### Step 3: Quantitative Analysis

Compute across 7 dimensions:

1. **Volume** — events/day, events/session, sessions/day, total events
2. **Routing rates** — NONE%, routed-to-files%, EVAL:true%
3. **File distribution** — load frequency per memory file, files never loaded in period
4. **Token cost** — median and max retrieval size in bytes, estimated tokens (~4 chars/token), total retrieval bytes for period
5. **Dedup effectiveness** — count of `[DEDUP skipped:]` entries in log annotations, which files were deduped most
6. **Pre-filter rates** — count of SKIPPED entries by reason (short-continuation, machine-prompt, url-only)
7. **Error rate** — any ERROR entries in `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/memory-error.log`

### Step 4: Qualitative Sampling

Sample from the filtered log entries:

**Routed entries (10-15 samples across the period):**
- For each, read the PROMPT and ROUTING lines
- Grade routing as: **correct**, **over-broad** (loaded unnecessary files), or **wrong** (loaded clearly irrelevant files)
- Note any patterns in over-broad or wrong routing

**NONE entries with personal signals (5-10 samples):**
- Search NONE-routed entries for personal keywords: Alex, Sam, frustrated, worried, stressed, moving, relocating, visa, taxes, job search, budget, savings
- Grade each as: **correct NONE** (truly no memory needed) or **false negative** (should have loaded a file)
- This directly measures whether the personal-context routing fix is working

### Step 5: Delta Comparison

Compare current metrics against `baseline_metrics` from the watermark. Compute deltas for:

| Metric | Baseline | Current | Delta |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| NONE rate % | from watermark | computed | +/- |
| Routed rate % | from watermark | computed | +/- |
| EVAL:true rate % | from watermark | computed | +/- |
| False negatives (estimated) | from watermark | from sampling | +/- |
| Max retrieval bytes | from watermark | computed | +/- |
| Never-loaded files | from watermark | computed | list diff |

Flag any metric that moved in the wrong direction (e.g., false negatives increased, max retrieval exceeded the 15K cap).

### Step 6: Report

Output a structured report to the conversation (not a file, unless the user asks):

```
## Memory Retrieval Analysis Report
**Period:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD | **Events:** N | **Sessions:** N

### Metrics vs Baseline
[delta comparison table from Step 5]

### Top Findings
- [numbered list of key observations, improvements, and remaining issues]

### Routing Quality (Sampled)
- Correct: N/M (X%)
- Over-broad: N/M (X%)
- Wrong: N/M (X%)

### False Negative Check
- Checked N NONE entries with personal keywords
- False negatives found: N [list if any]

### Dedup Effectiveness
- [dedup stats if available]

### Recommendations
- [concrete, actionable items — reference specific files/lines if proposing code changes]
```

### Step 7: Update Watermark

Write updated `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/context-router-watermark.json`:
- Set `last_analysis` to current UTC timestamp
- Set `baseline_metrics` to current analysis metrics
- **Preserve** `deployed_at` and `deployed_commit` from original watermark (these are historical facts about the last code deployment, not analysis metadata)
- Update `notes` with a one-line summary of this analysis

## Guidelines

- **Context protection:** Always delegate log parsing to an agent. Logs can be 100K+ — never load them into the main conversation.
- **Aggregates only:** The report should contain aggregated metrics and selected examples, never raw log dumps.
- **Actionable recommendations:** If recommending changes, reference specific lines in `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/hooks/context-router.py` or entries in `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/memory/memory-catalog.json`.
- **Honest grading:** Don't inflate routing quality grades. If a routing decision is questionable, call it out. The point is to find problems.
- **Watermark discipline:** Always read watermark before analysis, always update after. This is the mechanism that prevents stale data from polluting future runs.
