"""merge: one agent per group of overlapping findings, asked which are one defect.

The finders run independently, one per dimension, and `find` drops only
word-for-word copies, so one defect reported by three finders in three
wordings survives as three findings. This stage groups the confirmed and
unverifiable findings in each file whose line ranges overlap or nearly touch,
and asks one agent per group of two or more which of them describe the same
defect. Each such set becomes one finding that keeps:

- the highest severity in the set;
- every citation, and every finder that reported it;
- the id, claim and verdict of the finding it is merged into, which is a
  confirmed one where the set has one, then the most severe, then the first.

Every finding merged away goes to `state.merged` with the id it was merged
into. An agent failure leaves its group unmerged and is listed in
`state.errors`.
