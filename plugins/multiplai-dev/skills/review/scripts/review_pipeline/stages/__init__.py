"""Stages: find → verify → prescribe → check_fix.

Each is `async def run_<stage>(state, ctx) -> state`. A stage returns at once
when `state.stage` is already past it, and skips items it already has a
result for, so a resumed run repeats no finished work.

Only `RepoTrustError` and `BudgetExceededError` escape a stage. Any other
agent failure is logged at ERROR and turned into the conservative outcome for
that item (no findings from that finder, `unverifiable`, no verified fix).
