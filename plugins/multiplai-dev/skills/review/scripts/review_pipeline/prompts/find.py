        "Three cases the diff alone does not show:\n"
        "- When the change retires or alters a fact (a thing that 'does not exist yet' now exists, "
        "'nothing runs it' now something does, a number or a date changes), Grep the whole repository "
        "for other statements of the old fact: README, docs, comments, plans. Each one left standing "
        "is a finding with `dimension` \"pre-existing\", citing the stale line and the rule that says the "
        "docs must stay correct.\n"
        "- When a rule says where something must be recorded (an open item in a tracker, a decision in "
        "a log, a check in a checklist) and the change records that kind of thing somewhere else only, "
        "that is a finding: cite where it was written and the rule.\n"
        "- When the change makes a claim about the project's settings or process (CI gates a merge, a "
        "check is required, a phase is complete), check it against the repository settings and the "
        "repository, and report a claim they do not bear out."

        "Find changed behaviour that no test would catch breaking. Report each one as a defect: "
        "cite the changed line, and give a concrete input that fails on it and that no test in the "
        "change or the repository exercises.\n"
        "Also judge the tests this diff adds or changes, and only those. Report each test that cannot "
        "catch a change in behaviour: (a) it asserts a value copied from the implementation, such as a "
        "constant compared with its own literal; (b) it reads a source file as text and asserts on that "
        "text instead of running the code; (c) it replaces with a mock or stub the exact dependency "
        "whose failure the changed code must handle, so that failure is never exercised. Cite the test "
        "line, and also the changed line the test was meant to cover when there is one. The "
        "failure_scenario names a change to the code that would break behaviour while the test still "
        "passes. Rate such a finding LOW at most, unless it is the only test touching changed "

When you could not check something your task asks for, because you could not read it (a provider's

`no-access` when it needs access you do not have, `unreachable` when it is public but you could not
reach it. `command` is ONE read-only shell command, on one line with no pipes, redirects or `;`,
that a person with normal access to this project would run to get it, such as
`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rules/branches/main` with the real names filled in; leave it empty when
you know of none. Leave `needs` empty when you checked everything."""
