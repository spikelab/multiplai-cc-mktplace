"""Memory catalog generator.

Implements MemoryGenerator, a GeneratorBase subclass that catalogs
memory files (*.md) from the configured memory directory.

Design Decision 5: Preserves hand-authored fields (sections, bundle,
co_retrieve_for) across regeneration via merge_entry() override.

``section_anchors`` used to be in that preserved set and is now
generated — see the note on ``_HAND_AUTHORED_FIELDS`` below.

# Hand-authored fields preserved during merge. intent_domains and
# anti_domains are emitted by the LLM on first generation but may be
# hand-tuned later — preserving them across regeneration prevents the
# LLM from silently overwriting curated routing hints.
#
# ``section_anchors`` is deliberately NOT in this list. It is derived
# from the file's own H2 headers, so preserving it would freeze the
# first value ever written: a file could gain, rename, or drop a
# section and the anchors would never follow. A stale anchor is not a
# loud failure either — ``section_loader`` falls back to the whole
# file — so the rot would be invisible forever. Regeneration is already
# content-hash-gated (``generators/base.py``), so anchors are only
# re-derived when the file actually changed.
