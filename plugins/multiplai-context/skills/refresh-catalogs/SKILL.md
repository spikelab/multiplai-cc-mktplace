# Refresh Catalogs

Manually regenerate catalog indexes for memory, diary, skills, and resources. This skill invokes the catalog dispatcher (`generate_catalogs` via `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_catalog.py"`) to rebuild catalog files used by the context manager for fast routing.

## Usage

By default (no arguments), all enabled catalogs are regenerated using state-aware skipping — only catalogs whose source content has changed since the last run are rebuilt. Memory and diary catalogs are always processed (mandatory). Skills and resources catalogs only run if enabled in the plugin configuration.

### Flags

- **`--force`** — Force regeneration of all enabled catalogs, bypassing state-aware skipping. Ignores content hash state and regenerates regardless of whether sources have changed. Pass `--force` flag through to the dispatcher.
- **`--dry-run`** — Preview mode. Reports what catalogs would be regenerated or skipped without writing any files, modifying `.generation-state.json`, or making LLM calls. Dry-run output shows which generators would run and which would be skipped. No side effects.
- **`--only <generators>`** — Selectively regenerate specific catalogs. Provide a comma-separated list of generator names: `memory`, `diary`, `skills`, `resources`. Example: `--only memory,diary` runs only those two generators. **`--only` is an explicit override: a generator named here runs even if its `enable_*` config flag is off** (e.g. `--only resources` rebuilds the resources catalog while `enable_resources` stays `false`, so you can keep a fresh index without turning on injection). The only hard requirement that still applies is `resources_dir` — `--only resources` no-ops if no resources directory is configured.

### Combinations

- `--dry-run --force` — Shows all enabled catalogs as pending (since force bypasses skip logic).
- `--only diary --force` — Force-regenerates only the diary catalog.
- `--only skills --dry-run` — Preview what the skills catalog generator would do.

## Steps

1. **Parse flags** from the user's invocation to determine mode (default, force, dry-run) and any generator filter.

2. **Invoke the catalog dispatcher:**
   Run `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_catalog.py"` with the appropriate flags:
   - Default: `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_catalog.py"`
   - Force: `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_catalog.py" --force`
   - Dry-run: `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_catalog.py" --dry-run`
   - Selective: `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_catalog.py" --only memory,diary`
   - Combined: `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_catalog.py" --force --dry-run`

3. **Report per-catalog status** as a summary table:
   - Each catalog gets its own status line: **regenerated** (success), **skipped** (unchanged), or **failed** (with error reason).
   - Show counts: sources processed, entries generated, entries skipped, entries pruned.
   - On first run or with a missing/corrupt state file, all catalogs are regenerated since no prior state exists. The dispatcher handles graceful recovery from corrupt or invalid `.generation-state.json`.

## Error Handling

- If a generator fails, other generators still run — failures are isolated per catalog.
- Missing source directories (e.g., diary directory doesn't exist) cause that catalog to be skipped gracefully with a clear message, not a crash.
- Missing or corrupt `.generation-state.json` triggers full regeneration for all catalogs (equivalent to `--force` for the first run).
- All LLM calls go through `model_client` using the configured `catalog_model` and `catalog_reasoning_effort` settings. No direct API calls or new external dependencies.

## Configuration

The dispatcher respects these `plugin.json` userConfig settings:
- `catalog_model` — Model for LLM-based catalog generation (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- `catalog_reasoning_effort` — Reasoning effort level: low, medium, high (default: medium)
- `enable_skills` — Whether to include the skills catalog generator (default: false)
- `enable_resources` — Whether to include the resources catalog generator (default: false)
- `resources_dir` — Directory to scan for resources (required when enable_resources is true)

## Operational Notes

- **Interpreter:** `generate_catalog.py` re-execs itself into the managed venv (`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/venv/bin/python`, which carries `claude-agent-sdk`) via `venv_guard`. Invoke it with plain `python` and let it self-route — do not force a project/uv venv, which lacks the SDK and fails with "model client unavailable".
- **Exit code 1 means partial errors, not total failure.** The catalog is still written for every source that succeeded; re-run to fill gaps. A common per-file error is a `429 "usage credits are required for long context requests"` on very large files — trim/split those or re-run when credits allow.
- **Do not background-detach or pattern-kill the run.** It spawns bounded `claude` CLI subprocesses (concurrency = `catalog_concurrency`, default 5), which is fine in-container. `pkill -f generate_catalog` will also match the calling shell and kill the job — kill the specific python PID if you must stop it.
- **Concurrency:** raise/lower with the `catalog_concurrency` userConfig (default 5) if you hit rate limits or want faster throughput.
