Collects fresh data from session transcripts, then reports from the cost ledger. Triggers on 'what did this chat cost', 'how much did X cost', 'costs this month', 'token spend', 'cost report', 'what did that PR/branch cost'."

# Costs — Usage Cost Accounting

Reports what multiplai usage *would have billed* at Claude API list prices,
from the append-only cost ledger in `<data_dir>/costs/`. Two scripts:

- `collect_costs.py` — incrementally scans `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/**/*.jsonl`
  and appends priced records to the ledger. Idempotent; first run is a full
  backfill, later runs read only new bytes.
- `costs_report.py` — aggregates the ledger.

## Steps

1. **Collect first** so the report includes recent sessions:
   ```
   uv run --all-packages --project "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../.." "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/collect_costs.py"
   ```
2. **Report** based on what the user asked:

   | User asks | Command |
   |---|---|
   | overall / this month | `costs_report.py` |
   | a specific month | `costs_report.py --month YYYY-MM` |
   | this chat / a session | `costs_report.py --session <id-prefix>` (current session id is in the transcript filename) |
   | per skill | `costs_report.py --all --by skill` |
   | per project / model / day / component | `costs_report.py --by project\|model\|day\|component` |
   | per branch | `costs_report.py --all --by branch` |
   | one branch | `costs_report.py --branch <name>` (reads all months; `--branch "(none)"` for unattributed) |
   | a PR | resolve the branch with `gh`, then `--branch` — see below |
   | cost per completed task | `costs_report.py --all --group task --pr-join --project-dir <repo>` |
   | cost per buildme block | `costs_report.py --all --group build --project-dir <repo>` |
   | cache utilization | `costs_report.py --all --report cache [--cache-threshold 0.5]` |

   All via `uv run --all-packages --project "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../.." "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/costs_report.py" ...`.
   Add `--json` when you need to post-process numbers.

3. Present the relevant numbers concisely. Always mention once: costs are
   **API-equivalent** (list-price USD) — on a subscription nothing was actually
   billed per call.

## Cost of a PR

`costs_report.py` is deliberately `gh`-free; PR→branch resolution happens here:

1. Resolve the PR's branch:
   ```
   gh pr view <num> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json headRefName -q .headRefName
   ```
   (batch: `gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state all --json number,headRefName`)
2. Report on it:
   ```
   uv run --all-packages --project "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../.." "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/costs_report.py" --branch <that-branch>
   ```
3. If several PRs were cut from one branch, they **share** the branch's cost —
   say so when presenting the number.

## Cost per completed task

Raw tokens and raw dollars answer "what did we spend", not "what did it cost to
get something done". Two outcome units are available:

- `--group task --pr-join` — a *task* is a branch whose PR state resolves via
  `gh` (merged / closed / open / no-pr). Rows carry cost + tokens + outcome, and
  the summary divides total cost by merged-PR count, with per-task median/p90.
  A repo `gh` cannot reach degrades to `no-pr` rather than failing the report.
- `--group build` — buildme's finer signal, joined from
  `specs/changes/*/.build-state.json`: cost per DONE block *and* cost per FAILED
  block. The failed-block figure is the retry-and-loop spend, which is where
  verification changes (adjudication, reviewer panels) either pay for themselves
  or don't.

**Framing rule — cross-model comparisons must be per-outcome, never
per-token.** Different models tokenize differently, so the same work yields
different token counts; a cheaper per-token model that loops twice is more
expensive. When comparing models or pipeline versions, quote cost per merged PR
or per DONE block. Quote per-token numbers only within one model.

## Cache utilization

`--report cache` computes, per project/skill/component, the hit ratio
`cr / (in + cr)` and the cache-write share, flagging rows under the threshold
(default 50%). The data is already in every ledger record — no collector
change, so it works on historical months.

Baseline measured 2026-07-25 over the whole ledger: **99.7% overall hit ratio**
(4.77B cached / 4.78B eligible tokens); every SDK component
(deep-research, buildme, dream, catalogs, model_client) sat at 100.0%, and
interactive at 99.7%. Cache breakpoints in the in-house pipelines were already
placed correctly — the finding is "already optimal", not a fix. Write share is
the number to watch instead: `model_client` writes 65% and `catalogs` 36%, i.e.
they re-write prefixes more often than they reuse them.

## Branch attribution caveats

- `branch` comes from the transcript's per-entry `gitBranch` field, which
  reflects the repo at the session's **cwd**. Sessions run at the workspace
  root record the workspace repo's branch (usually `main`) even when the work
  targeted a sub-project via `git -C`. Sessions run inside a worktree or
  sub-project (the default workflow for non-trivial changes) attribute
  correctly. A mid-session `git checkout` splits records across branches.
- Records collected before this feature show `(none)` until the one-time
  enrichment is run:
  ```
  uv run --all-packages --project "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../.." "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/collect_costs.py" --backfill-branches
  ```
  Idempotent; safe to re-run. Non-git cwds and SDK-sourced records stay `(none)`.

## Notes

- Skill spans inside interactive chats are approximate by construction (a
  skill is prompt injection, not a separate API context). SDK pipeline
  components (buildme, deep-research, dream) are exact.
- Subagent traffic is `sidechain` records; `--session` shows the
  main/subagent split.
- Unknown models are priced at fallback rates and flagged
  `pricing_fallback: true` in the ledger.
